It's that time of year again.  tax time that is.  I decided to take a look at what the Big Boys are doing to help you with investments.
</p>

<p>Most are great for "Stock Traders" which in other words, these sites are designed for <i>losers</i>.   While some people and institutions can and do make money picking and selling stocks, most (> 70%) do not beat major indexes and incur heavy tax burdens.  "Modern" portfolio theory is more about asset allocation and diversitication.  I'm not an expert here, and the beauty of the theory is, unlike stock picking, you do <i>not</i> need to be an expert!  Pick a bunch of uncorrelated  investments, divide them up somehow, occassionally rebalance, do not sell (since you'll incur taxes).

<ul>
<li> What is the asset allocation of my portfolio?</li>
<li> How close is my portfolio to  my target allocation?</li>
<li> What do I need to do to rebalance?</li>
<li> How can I optimize my portfolio across taxable and non-taxable accounts</li>
