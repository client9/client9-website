title: How to store passwords in the database with PHP
---
<p>
While the results will apply to any language, this article will focus on implementation in PHP.
</p>

<h3>The Risk Model</h3>

<p>We are trying to protect against the case where a large portion of your member's passwords are exposed, i.e. "bulk decryption".  Ideally, if someone posted <tt>select * from passwords</tt> on the interwebz, it would be annoying and embarrassing, but not <i>terminal</i>.   Perhaps that is a bit extreme, but makes the point.
</p>

<p>We are not trying to protect against the case of cracking a single persons password.   People don't use "random strings" for passwords.  They use "word-like" passwords and the password crackers have all sorts of rules to generate these type of strings to test.   We want a scheme so that the effort of cracking one password is substantial, and gives no advantage to cracking any other.
</p>

<p>Fortunately, a lot of big brains have figured out three schemes that address these issues.  They are are all very similar in spirit: PKCS#5, bcrypt, and for lack of a better name crypt 2007.   All of these do the same thing: repeated hash iteration  so the cost of brute force dictionary attacks is really really slow, and with a random salt so that the efforts cracking one gives you nothing for others.
</p>

<h3>PKCS#5</h3>

<p>
It's a <a href="http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2127">standard</a>!  It's an <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2898">IETF RFC</a>!  But in open-source land, no body seems to use it.  What's even weirder is that it frequently does not even get mentioned in various "debates" you see online.  It's very simple to code, and based on existing cryptographic primitives.
</p>

<p>
The bad part of PKCS#5 is that is just turns a password into a bunch of bytes.  You have to invent (or not) a method to keep track of which hash algorithm you are using, the salt, and the iteration count.  That's not bad.  But I don't like inventing things if I don't have too.
</p>

<p>I found a few PHP implementations on the web.  Mostly without licensing and without test vectors.  Repeat after me: "I will not use cryptography I find on the web without standard test vectors."  It's like "friends of your parents" asking to drive you home.  Just keep walking...</p>

<h3>bcrypt</h3>

<p>
By bcrypt, we mean the invention description in <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix99/">1999 Usenix</a> paper <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix99/provos.html">A Future-Adaptable Password Scheme</a>, by Niels Provos and David Mazières.  And not <a href="http://beecrypt.sourceforge.net/">beecrypt</a> nor <a href="http://bcrypt.sourceforge.net/">"bcrypt-the-file-encryptor</a>.  It is also referred to as the "Blowfish hash function", at least the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/crypt.html">FreeBSD manual</a> does.
</p>

<p>
bcrypt is designed by solid folks. <a href="http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/">Neils Provos</a> now works at <a href="http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/">Google</a> and does easy stuff, like <a href="http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/">libevent</a> and <a href="http://www.provos.org/index.php?/archives/84-Heat-treating-the-Wakizashi.html">makes swords at home</a>.  <a href="http://www.scs.stanford.edu/~dm/">David Mazière"</a> who now runs <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>'s <a href="http://www.scs.stanford.edu/">Secure Computing Group</a>.  
</p>

<p>bcrypt is integrated into <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>, which is arguably the most secure server-class operating system.</p>

<p>
The output of bcrypt is in a nice 'unix-style' crypt format: <code>$2a$COST$SALT$HASHED$</code>.  This solves one problem with PKCS#5.
</p>

<p>
The main PHP implementation, <a href="http://www.openwall.com/phpass/">phpass</a> is designed for software "product", like <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">wordpress</a>, that will be installed on unknown systems.  And for this, it does a good job.  It's pure php, it even runs on PHP 3 (yes THREE) to 5.3, and provides reasonable password security.
</p>

<p>
So what's my problem?
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Where are the test vectors!  Sorry, I don't trust any algorithm that I have to go hunting for test vectors.  Even the original paper didn't have test vectors.  The <a href="http://ftp5.usa.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/src/lib/libc/crypt/bcrypt.c
">original source</a> does not have test vectors.  WTF.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_For_Test">DTF</a>!
</p></li>

<li><p>
The MD5 hash, iterated DES crypt, and blowfish, are either "not standard" or "not approved" or "deprecated."  Nothing wrong with that <i>per-se</i>, it's just I have to pass security audits.</p></li>

<li><p>phpass on many (most?) systems will not use bcrypt but "degrade" into iterated MD5 hash or iterated DES crypt, neither of which is standard nor documented.  Do those work "ok" -- sure they do, they burn a lot of CPUs (good) and with no way  of skipping steps and jumping to the final answer.  However this smells wrong to me. (it will use be bcrypt if you have blowfish installed, or if you are using PHP 5.3).  
</p></li>

<li><p>phpass is un-unit-testable.   You can not call directly the various algorithms.  You cannot pass in a salt, and it loads bytes from <tt>/dev/urandom</tt>.  Could I rewrite it?  Sure, and it wouldn't be that hard.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, so it's not perfect. If you are using phpass now, you are doing fine (although see timing tests below).  If everyone used phpass the world would be a better place.</p>

<p>And if you are using PHP 5.3, the last two problems go away, since bcrypt is directly since it's built into the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.crypt.php">crypt</a> function (this I like!).
</p>


<h3>Crypt 2007</h3>

<p>For lack of a better term, I'll call <a href="http://www.akkadia.org/drepper/">Ulrich Drepper</a>'s invention "crypt 2007".   The <a href="http://www.akkadia.org/drepper/sha-crypt.html">notes on the algorithm</a> nor <a href="http://www.akkadia.org/drepper/SHA-crypt.txt">the spec</a> doesn't mention PKCS#5 (why?), and basically says "bcrypt is more or less fine, but uses non-standard cryptography, which is going to be problem for compliance."   
</p>

<p>This version can use sha-256 or sha-512, and the algorithm is based on the original crypt, and been reviewed by security teams at Sun, IBM and RedHat.  Are there test vectors? Yes.</p>

<p>It's been in glib 2.7 (2007), and in more recent versions of Redhat (since <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=435804">5.2</a>) and Ubuntu linux (since <a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jaunty/man3/crypt.3.html">9.04</a>). Ubuntu 10.04 and Fedora 12 (if not eariler versions) defaults to SHA-512 with 5000 rounds.</p>

<p>If RedHat and friends can sell into governments with it, it's good enough for me.</p>

<p>And... it's built into PHP <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.crypt.php">crypt</a> starting with 5.3.2</p>

<h3>Here's what to do in PHP</h3>

<p>Here's my recommendations as of 28-Aug-2010.</p>

<p>
If you are <b>using PHP 4</b>, or writing software product -- <b>use phpass</b>.   You'll probably default to the original MD5 crypt.  So be it.  Use a iteration count of at least XX
</p>

<p>If <b>required to use PKCS5</b>, here's the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/securestring/source/browse/trunk/php/pbkdf2.php">pure php version</a>.   Unit tests are in the same directory.
</p>

<p>Otherwise, with <b>PHP 5</b> (any version), do this:  <b>use crypt sha-512</b> or if you need smaller output size, use crypt sha-256, <b>with at least 5000 rounds</b> using <b><a href="">crypt2007.php</a></b>.

<ul>
<li>Correctly generates salt, both the random bits, and the "magic number" to get the right algorithm.</li>
<li>If using PHP 5.3.2 and up, the native crypt will be called</li>
<li>If not, it falls back to a pure php version</li>
<li>Of course it has unit tests and test vectors</li>
</ul>


<p>Even if you are using 5.3.2, you don't want to use PHP's crypt directly.  It's a bit weird.  Partially since it is modeled after the C function, and partially because it's PHP: (emphasis mine)</p>

<blockquote>
An optional salt string to base the hashing on. <i>If not provided, the behaviour is defined by the algorithm implementation and can lead to unexpected results.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>Gotta love that.  It's as if they didn't actually write the code.  Anyways, salt has very specific length and allowable character requirements.  crypt2007.php takes care of all that.</p>

<h3>More Notes!</h3>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.unix.com/man-page/All/1/mkpasswd/">mkpasswd</a> is a nice command line interface into crypt.  It's probably not installed by default.
</p>

<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install mkpasswd
$ mkpasswd -m sha-512 -S 123456 -R 5000  BLAHBLAHBLAH
$6$rounds=5000$123456$bunchofrandomchars
</pre>

<p>
What password scheme is used on linux systems is controlled by <tt>/etc/login.defs</tt>.
