title: Beyond C Python
---
<p>C Python is the implementation of Python  that most of use from <a href="http://www.python.org/">python.org</a></p>.

<h2>Cython (and PyRex)</h2>
<p>Both of these allow writing C python extensions by writing "python" code that understands C data structures.  The result is a pure C file that can be compiled "Python" is in quotes since it's subset of python.</p>

<p>I haven't tried to converting an ordinary python program and turned it into a C module to see what happens.</a>

<h2>Psyco</h2>
<p><a href="http://psyco.sourceforge.net/index.html">Psyco is a mini-JIT.  Add: </p>
<pre>
import psyco
psyco.full()
</pre>
<p>... and BOOM.  You application is twice as fast.  Maybe even more.</p>

<p>The gotcha is that it doesn't support true x86_64, so you may have recompile C Python to be 32-bits, and development has basically stopped and moved to PyPy (below).  The gotcha is that PyPy is probably years away from being production ready.  It's also likely any "new" features in Python 2.4 and above (generators, iterators) prevent the function from being JIT-ed.</p>

<h2>Stackless</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.stackless.com/">Stackless</a> is a modification of regular Python to support true <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine">coroutines</a>, which allows massive multiprocessing without threads, among other things.  (I'm sure there is a better description of this-- sorry stackless guys!)</p>

<h2>TinyPy</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.tinypy.org/">TinyPy</a> is a full from-scratch python interpreter in C in under 65k lines of code.  It handles most if not all of the regular python syntax. I'm not <i>exactly</i> sure the motivation, but it's interesting.</p>

<h2>Jython</h2> 
<p>It's python, written in Java.  One big "advantage" to Jython over C Python is that java gives you true threads, so you can use multiple CPUs.</p>

<h2>IronPython</h2>
<p><a href="">IronPython</a> is implementation in C# with support of .Net and CLR.  I'm not a windows guy, so I can't really comment on this.</p>

<h2>ShedSkin</h2>
<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/shedskin/">ShedSkin</a> takes <i>small</i> python programs (with restrictions) and converts them to C++.</p>

<h2> PyPy </h2>
<p><a href="http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/home.html">PyPy</a> is ambitious project, and I'll probably butcher the description. The problem they are confronting is that if you write an implementation of a programming language in C or Java, then it's very hard to make <i>global</i> changes to it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing how memory is managed (e.g. reference counting to garbage collection)</li>
<li>Thread support: posix or coroutines</li>
<li>Syntax changes or enhancements</li>
<li>Different "intermediate format" or bytecode</li>
<li>Object models for security and tainting</li>
<li>JIT support</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, right now the "language" is tightly coupled to the "implementation".  PyPy attempts to solve this problem by letting you implement the language in Python (orders of magnitude easier than writing in C or Java), which will be magically analyzed and any number of implementations can be produced, including a specialized, customized JIT.</p>

<p>That's my take, but read <a href="http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/architecture.html">their description</a>.</p>

<p>They have written their own implementation of python in python (well a subset they call RPython), and if I read the benchmarks correctly, the PyPy generated version is no faster than the existing C Python.  But they are just getting started.  It might take another year to make it really rock, then look out.</p>

<p>In the meantime, checkout their <a href="http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/js/using.html">python to javascript translator</a>, which may be useful for generating RPC interfaces.</p>

<h2>pyjamas</h2>

<p>Speaking of whicht, it's worth noting <a href="http://pyjs.org/">pyjamas</a>, a wholesale re-implementation of Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">GWT</a> in python, has it's own python-to-javascript "compiler".  I'm not sure how well it works for non-UI code however.</p>
