title: Slides from NYCBUG crypto talk posted
---
<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>The nice people at <a href="http://nycbug.org/">NYCBUG</a> invited me to speak on cryptography on 05-Sept-2007. About 20 (?) people showed up ranging from people who had no exposure to crypto to some people who worked on VPNs, developers to sysadmins -- all types with lots of excellent questions. Thanks everyone for coming -- it was really great to meet you.</p>

<p>
I reworked the slides a bit based on feedback from that day and posted them <a href="http://modp.com/slides/reallyappliedcryptography1.html">here</a>.

 What's my problem?  Why didn't I take any photos?  Why didn't I post here <i>before</i> I spoke? Oh well.  Next time!  There are rumors I'll do something similar for the NYC php group.</p>
