---
My work at <a href="http://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a> involving <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/safebrowsing/">Google Safe Browsing</a> has now been open-sourced on <a href="https://github.com/etsy/gsb4ugc">github</a>.  I also wrote about it on <a href="http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2012/03/04/google-safe-browsing/">Code As Craft</a>.  Enjoy!
