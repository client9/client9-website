title: Version 2.0 of print_r and var_dump for php
---
<p>A colleague just showed me <a href="http://krumo.sourceforge.net/">krumo</a>, which is "Version 2.0 of print_r() and var_dump();".  This is for php kids, and krumo ain't kidding -- it's a nifty redo of those debugging functions with collapsable trees, colors, line numbers, the work.  Check it out.</p>
