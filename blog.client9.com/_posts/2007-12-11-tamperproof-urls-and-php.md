title: Tamperproof URLs and PHP
---
<p>
I finally posted my slides for "Tamperproof URLS and PHP" from the NYPHP talk on 27-Nov-2007 at <a href="http://modp.com/slides/securestring/">http://modp.com/slides/securestring/</a>.    In addition the source code and unit test are posted.  This is a temporary spot until code.google.com bumps up my resources and then it will go into SVN.</p>

<p>Thank you all for coming.  Based on the questions and feedback, I have completely revamped the slides and added a lot more examples.  Enjoy! --nickg
