title: Another C++ style guide from LLVM

<p><a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> is ... uhh, a "compiler infrastructure project".   Definitely check out... it might be a GCC replacement in a few years</p>.

<p>They published a very different type of <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html">style guide</a>, with different perspective.   In particular, check out the part on <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html#ll_iostream">iostreams</a></p>
