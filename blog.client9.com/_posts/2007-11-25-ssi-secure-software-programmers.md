title: SSI Secure Software Programmers Certificates
---
<p>The <a href="http://www.sans-ssi.org/">Software Security Institute</a> is granting "Secure Software Programmers certiÔ¨Åcation".  Right now, tests exists for Java/J2EE and C, but other tests are coming for C++, PHP, perl, and .NET/ASP.</p>

<p>The C/C++ mostly covers low-level programming and bad system calls (more on this in another post).  The Java one looks at correct configuration of J2EE and threading.   I think the php or perl tests will cover Cross Site Scripting and SQL injection issues once it comes out.</p>

<p>Normally I think programming certificates are worthless since most of them cover stuff you <i>have</i> to know just to do your regular job.   But security is a little different since it's issues around the edges and if you never seen the issue it's unlikely you'll think about it.  Even better, it's a <i>sure-thing</i> your employer will pay for it ($500)!</p>

Check it out and let me know what you think.
