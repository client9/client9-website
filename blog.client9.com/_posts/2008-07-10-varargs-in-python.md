title: Varargs in Python

<p>
"Varargs" is C/C++ (?) name for "variable-length argument lists" for functions and methods, used for example by <code>printf</code>.  In python, this: <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/controlflow.html#arbitrary-argument-lists">Arbitrary Function Arguments</a> is what you are looking for (Sections 4.7.3 and 4.74).
