title: The Pitfalls of Java as a First Programming Language
---
<p>I bumped into an interesting article <a href="http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/CrossTalk/2008/01/0801DewarSchonberg.html">Computer Science Education: Where Are The Software Engineers of Tomorrow</a> which is really about why Java is poor <i>first</i> language to learn.  (I found this by way of  <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/gb/inquirer/news/2008/01/08/boffins-deride-java">The Inquirer</a> -- lots of funny comments).  The authors are professors at NYU.
</p>

<p>Juicy quotes include:</p>

<blockquote>
Java ... encourages the programmer to approach problem-solving like a plumber in a hardware store: by rummaging through a multitude of drawers (i.e. packages) we will end up finding some gadget (i.e. class) that does roughly what we want. How it does it is not interesting!
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
It [Texas A&M] did [teach Java as the first language]. Then I started teaching C++ to the electrical engineers and when the EE students started to out-program the CS students, the CS department switched to C++.
</blockquote>

<p>It's not a slam on Java, it's slam as using it as a first language, or perhaps how Java and programming are taught together. The author insist everyone must learn C, C++, Lisp, Java, and ... Ada.  Huh?  Well, the authors also run some Ada company.  Oh well.</p>

<p>An interesting read, whether or not if you agree with their conclusions.</p>
