Ok, that CouchDb Guy, Damien Katz, not only is writing some great code, but also writing some great articles.
  This one should be required reading:<a href="http://damienkatz.net/2006/04/error_code_vs_e.html">Error codes or Exceptions? Why is Reliable Software so Hard?</a>.    It's not <i>really</i> about error codes and exceptions.   That's just the hook. uhhhhh, yeah, something like that anyways.
