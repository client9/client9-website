<p>
For those new to my blog, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/stringencoders/">stringencoders</a> is a collection of crazy C algorithms to do basic stuff like base64 encoding, upper and lower casing, and double/int to string conversion.   Most applications don't need this type of performance.  It's for when your app needs <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbVKWCpNFhY">to go to 11</a>.
</p>

<p> Anyhoo, the code was picked up on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/bja8c/stringencoders_a_collection_of_high_performance/">Reddit</a>.  Always entertaining.
