title: My Dumb Guide to Amazon AWS EC2 - Intro
---
So, it turns out I'm building a multi-tiered site on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon's EC2 service</a>.  A lot of the doco on the web is sadly outdated, and while the Amazon's tutorials are nice, I needed something I could use to get my team to speed quickly.

I'm going to use the blog format as a work-in-progress document.  Perhaps convert it to a wiki once it's more organized.

For this I'll be using Canonical's official Ubunutu (Karmic) 9.10 server release.

I'll also be using the "management console" instead of the official APIs and java command line tools.  Odds are you'll use a different set of APIs appropriate for your choice of programming language anyways.
