title: If you are in tech and don't have a blog
---
<p>What?  You are in tech and don't have a blog?</p>

<p>
This came up at a.... party.  Yeah my life is really exciting.  Anyways, someone (Ilya) didn't have a blog and didn't really know what to write about.  This person manages dozens of people and programs in as many languages.
</p>

<p>
I understand the problem.  All the blogs I read, are very well-written, maybe even <i>proof-read</i> and sticking to a single topic.  Writing that type of blog is hard.  Plus, for some of us writing is a hard and slow process.   So don't that.
</p>

<p>
If you are in tech,  my guess is at least one hour of your day is just spent <i>finding answers</i> to technical problems.   Then when you figure it out, write a blog entry.   Just like "every time you learn a new word, use it in sentence."
</p>

<p>
Is this a blog people will check everyday?  No.  Will your blog be coherant and stick to a single topic?  No. Will search engine index this and be very useful to others? Yes!   You will be amazed how many people will read your articles.  Now I have top ranked articles on many topics.  And I use my own blog as reference since I forget my own solutions!
</p>

<p>Now you have no excuse!   Start that blog before your next employer asks to see it.</p>

Well, reading your blog inspired me to finally get down to business and start mine.  I have many of the same goals... snippets of good code, weird python corners... a cache of small ideas that might eventually bloom into big ones.

I agree with you. I started to write what I&#39;ve learned in my blog for my own reference as well as for maybe someone who needs the same solutions.<br /><br />Just write it down, and it could be useful to someone else. :-)
