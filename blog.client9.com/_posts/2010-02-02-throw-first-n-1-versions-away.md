title: Throw the First (n-1) Versions Away
---
<p>
There is a great article on scaling web apps on <a href="http://arstechnica.com/">Ars Technica</a>, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/data-centers/2010/02/what-second-life-can-teach-all-companies-about-scaling-web-apps.ars/">What Second Life can teach all companies about scaling web apps</a>, which is about.. well, exactly that the title says.
</p>

<p>From this passaage:</p>
<blockquote>
... but herein lies a trap for smaller ones: the belief that you can "do it right the first time." (Or, in the young-but-growing scenario, "do it right the second time.") This unlikely to be true in the real world, so successful scaling depends on adapting your technology as the system grows.
</blockquote>

<p>Regarding this, I said "You always throw the first one away"</p>

<p>My collegue <a href="http://ross-snyder.com/">Ross</a> improved upon this with:</p>

<blockquote>
I'd say you throw the first (n-1) away since you're never really "done"
</blockquote>

<p>There is a great mathematical induction or recursion joke in here.  This is left as an  exercise to the reader.</p>
