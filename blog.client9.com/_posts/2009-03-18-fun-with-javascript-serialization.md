title: Fun with Javascript Serialization
---
<p>My friend Andy forwarded me this link: <a href="http://code.flickr.com/blog/2009/03/18/building-fast-client-side-searches/">Building Fast Client-Side Searches</a>.  It's an exercise in data serialization.  I especially like "store everything you need in one database text blob".  This is a technique that should be used more often.  Sadly they do not say which browser they were testing on.  I suspect this significantly changes from engine to engine.  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Using_JSON_in_Firefox">Firefox 3.5 will get native JSON parsing</a> which should help greatly.

<p>Anyways, it's a good read</p>
