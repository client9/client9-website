<p>Hi all,
</p>

<p>
I just released <a href="http://stringencoders.googlecode.com/">stringencoders 3.7.0</a>.  This fixes autotool/libtool which was borked on some platforms according to my spies.  It also fixes up some C++ header annoyances.  There are no logic changes, so if there is no need to update if it has been working for you so far.</p>

<p>
<b>BUT</b>, if you haven't updated since 3.4, please do so since 3.4 has a core dumping bug, and 3.5 are some minor issues with <code>modp_dtoa</code>.
</p>

<p>enjoy</p>
