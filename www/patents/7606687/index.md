> A proximity search engine for carrying out a proximity search with
> respect to a reference location uses as a reference frame the earth
> divided into tiles, which are predefined geographic regions of
> substantially equal areas. Records that are searched based on
> proximity to a reference location include location pointers, each of
> which identifies a particular tile that encompasses the physical
> location indicated by the corresponding record. When the proximity
> search is carried out, the tiles that are within a specified distance
> from the reference location are obtained and records having location
> pointers corresponding to such tiles are selected for inclusion in the
> search results.
