> Social network information maintained in a first database is shared
> with a second database. The operators of the second database use the
> social network information to better manage services provided to their
> customers and target particular information to their customers. The
> process begins with a request made to an application server of the
> first database by an application server of the second database, for
> social network information relevant to a set of individuals. The
> request includes identifying information of each individual in the
> set. The first database is then searched for matches with the
> identifying information in the request. If matches are found, the
> social network information relevant to those individuals for whom
> matches are found is shared with the second database.
